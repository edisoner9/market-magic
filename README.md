This repository is a collection of all "investing" related (i.e. money-losing) side projects. 

survivor_simulator.py is a demonstration of the survivorship bias in regards to random performance in the market. Starting with 1,000 trading accounts of $10,000 and an equal chance of scaling the account by 0, 1.4 2, .7, and .5 with each "year" that passes, probability tells us there's a good chance that many accounts survive at least 10 years. This might be one of the most revealing examples in "Fooled by Randomness" by Nassim Nicholas Taleb.

The Martingale repository simulates and graphs the Martingale betting system. 

Feel free to use the code so long as you cite my name (a single-line comment will suffice).
